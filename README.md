## About the language

> _Describe the language_
>
> - Kotlin was designned by JetBrians in July 2011. This has been in develpment for a year. The lead designer of this language wanted a language with certain feature and the only language known to them at that time is Scala. However Scala was slow to compile.
>
> - There are many interesting things about Kotlin including:
> 1. A language that can run on JVM and also be compiled to Javascript source code using the LLVM compiler infrastructure
> 2. It is Concise (Drastically reduce the amount of "Boilerplate" code)
> 3. It is safe (Avoids entire classes of error)
> 4. It is Interoperable (Can use exisiting libraries for JVM, Android and Browser)
> 5. It is Tool-friendly (Build it from any Java IDE or Command line)
> 6. It contains many Collections (Contains higher-order functions lambda expressions, operator overloading, lazy eval and muc more)
